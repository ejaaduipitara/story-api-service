### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- Latest Docker

### [Marqo database setup](https://docs.marqo.ai/1.5.0/#setup-and-installation)

1. To get the Marqo image, use the following command:

```shell
docker pull marqoai/marqo:1.5.1
```

2. To create the Marqo instance, run the following command:

```shell
docker rm -f marqo;docker run --name marqo -it --privileged -p 8882:8882 --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway -e "MARQO_MAX_INDEX_FIELDS=400" -e "MARQO_MAX_DOC_BYTES=200000" -e "MARQO_MAX_RETRIEVABLE_DOCS=600" -e "MARQO_MAX_NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS=2" -e "MARQO_MODELS_TO_PRELOAD=[\"flax-sentence-embeddings/all_datasets_v4_mpnet-base\"]" marqoai/marqo:1.5.1
```

# üîß 1. Installation

To use the code, you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: 
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DJP-Digital-Jaaduii-Pitara/story-api-service.git
    ```
    ```
   cd story-api-service
   ```

2. The code requires **Python 3.7 or higher** and some additional python packages. To install these packages, run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

3. To injest data to marqo

    ```bash
    python3 index_documents.py --marqo_url=<MARQO_URL> --index_name=<MARQO_INDEX_NAME> --folder_path=<PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE_DIRECTORY> --fresh_index
    ```
   --fresh_index: This is a flag that creating a new index or overwriting an existing one. Fresh indexing typically starts from scratch without using existing data.
   PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE_DIRECTORY should have only PDF, audio, video and txt file only.

   e.g.
   ```bash
   python3 index_documents.py --marqo_url=http://0.0.0.0:8882 --index_name=sakhi_rstory --folder_path=story_pdfs --fresh_index
   ```
   Create the index by using the above command. After creating the index add the index name in `config.ini` file.

   ```json
   [marqo]  
   index_name=<STORY_INDEX_NAME>
   ```

4. You will need an OCI account to store the audio file for response.

5. create another file **.env** which will hold the development credentials and add the following variables. Update the Azure OpenAI details, OCI object storage details and bhashini endpoint URL and API Key.

    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_BASE=<your_azure_openai_api_base_url>
    OPENAI_API_VERSION=<your_azure_api_version>
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_azure_api_key>
    GPT_MODEL=<your_gpt_model>
    LOG_LEVEL=<log_level>  # INFO, DEBUG, ERROR
    BHASHINI_ENDPOINT_URL=<your_bhashini_endpoint_url>
    BHASHINI_API_KEY=<your_bhashini_api_key>
    OCI_ENDPOINT_URL=<oracle_bucket_name>
    OCI_REGION_NAME=<oracle_region_name>
    OCI_BUCKET_NAME=<oracle_bucket_name>
    OCI_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<oracle_secret_access_key>
    OCI_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<oracle_access_key_id>
    SERVICE_ENVIRONMENT=<environment_name>
    MARQO_URL=<your_marqo_db_url>
    TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT_URL=<telemetry_service_base_url>
    TELEMETRY_LOG_ENABLED=<true_or_false>
    ```

# üèÉüèª 2. Running

Once the above installation steps are completed, run the following command in home directory of the repository in terminal

```bash
uvicorn main:app
```

Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to access the application.

The command `uvicorn main:app` refers to:

- `main`: the file `main.py` (the Python "module").
- `app`: the object created inside of `main.py` with the line `app = FastAPI()`.
- `--reload`:  make the server restart after code changes. Only do this for development.
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

# üìÉ 3. API Specification and Documentation

### `POST /v1/query`

#### API Function
API is used to generate activity/story based on user query and translation of text/audio from one language to another language in text/audio format. To achieve the same, Bhashini has been integrated. OCI object storage has been used to store translated audio files when audio is chosen as target output format.

```commandline
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/query' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "input": {
    "language": "en",
    "text": "string",
    "audio": "string"
  },
  "output": {
    "format": "text"
  }
}'
```

#### Request
| Request Input      |                                                       Value |
|:-------------------|----------------------------------|
| input.language     | en,bn,gu,hi,kn,ml,mr,or,pa,ta,te |
| input.text         | User entered question (any of the above language) |
| input.audio        | Public file URL Or Base64 encoded audio |
| output.format      | text or audio |

Required inputs are 'text', 'audio' and 'language'.

Either of the `text`(string) or `audio`(string) should be present. If both the values are given, `text` is taken for consideration. Another requirement is that the `language` should be same as the one given in text and audio (i.e, if you pass English as `language`, then your `text/audio` should contain queries in English language). The audio should either contain a publicly downloadable url of mp3 file or base64 encoded text of the mp3.
If output format is given as `text` than response will return text format only. If output format is given as `audio` than response will return text and audio both.

```json
{
   "input": {
      "text": "How to Teach Kids to Play Games", 
      "language": "en"
   },
   "output": {
      "format": "text"
   }
}
```

#### Successful Response

```json
{
  "output": {
    "text": "string",
    "audio": "string",
    "language": "en",
    "format": "text|audio"
  }
}
```

#### What happens during the API call?

Once the API is hit with proper request parameters, it is then checked for the presence of query_text. 

If query text is present, the translation of query text based on input language is done. Then the translated query text is given to langchain model which does the same work as `/query-with-langchain` endpoint. Then the paraphrased answer is again translated back to input_language. If the output_format is voice, the translated paraphrased answer is then converted to a mp3 file and uploaded to an OCI folder and made public.

If the query text is absent and audio url is present, then the audio url is downloaded and converted into text based on the input language. Once speech to text conversion in input language is finished, the same process mentioned above happens. One difference is that by default, the paraphrased answer is converted to voice irrespective of the output format since the input format is voice.
